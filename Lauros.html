            I got too many things that<br>

            Another siren sounds<br>
            The last straw, I'm leaving<br>
            It's time to leave this crowd</p>

        <p>In fact, I might go<br>
            First thing in the morning<br>
            To lay low<br>
            I gotta get out of here for real<br>
            Yeah, that sounds good to me, ah<br>
            Find some cleaner air to breathe<br>
            Ah yes<br>
            Get away from everything, ah<br>

        <p>Really and truly I should pack up<br>
            And find my way under the stars, I'll roll a sack up<br>
            And find some peace and quiet, get my spirits back up<br>
            Breathe in the oxygen, I'll find a place to shack up<br>
            That'll keep me on track, my friends<br>
            To get back<br>
            The things that I lack<br>
            To get back<br>
            The things that I lack<br>
            Yeah, that's it</p>

        <p>In fact I might go<br>
